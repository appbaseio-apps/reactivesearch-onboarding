		"text": "I was homeschooled my entire k-11 career in the US. So was my sibling. We&#x27;ve both gone on to graduate school. We&#x27;re quite functional socially.<p>We&#x27;re probably the most career-successful of the peer group of homeschoolers we grew up around; the least successful were a SAHM last I heard. Most were tradespeople in their dad&#x27;s profession. Well and good, I suppose.<p>There&#x27;s a heavy cost to be borne to do it proper-like; it really requires one parent to stay home and be the teacher - most multimedia curricula are total drek, largely because kids just aren&#x27;t that self-motivated to learn, they&#x27;d rather do legos or throw snowballs. Old Tom Sawyer stuff, you know. Human nature works best with a human teacher in meatspace.<p>For a US public policy perspective, I have a few thoughts - most relatively inflammatory. I don&#x27;t want to have a flamewar, but I think they merit some level of thought - email me to continue the conversation.<p>There&#x27;s a <i>huge</i> social cost to having diverse schooling; it funnels children out of the public schools into private schools and other alternatives, and provides a salt lake effect reducing the quality of children in schools. So I&#x27;m not actually a fan of private&#x2F;charter&#x2F;religous schools for that reason. It diverts funding and excellence. Homeschooling will never be popular enough (it&#x27;s <i>hard</i> work) to really consider it a serious competitor. But it&#x27;s reasonable to require tests periodically - enough parents fart around that it&#x27;s a real issue.<p>It&#x27;s my opinion that control has to pass out of the hands of local school boards upwards into state or federal level. There are far too many stories about local school boards funkifying their children&#x27;s grades or ruining a teacher&#x27;s career who gave their child bad grades. Similarly, teachers need not unduly worry about their career because an upset parent is panicing. There are <i>serious</i> issues with the structure of public schools in the US, and teachers need to be privileged much more than they are now. Admins and parents are legendary for causing issues.<p>It&#x27;s my opinion that a tiered education approach is proper for the US: one tier for college-bound children, one tier for trade-bound, and one tier for &quot;misc&quot;. Tiers should be broken out at 10 y&#x2F;o or so based on aptitude tests &amp; history, without much regard to parent&#x27;s opinion. Similarly, children who are disruptive in class need to be shuffled out of class.<p>Many people think school is about socializing. That is both true and a bad idea. It doesn&#x27;t have to be: anthropology and history would tell us that modern schools are a very new innovation, and generally you got socialized outside of the school system. Having your age-peers shape you primarily is contra the long standing human experience and is segregationist in concept. It&#x27;d be <i>much</i> better to focus on effective use of time in school and let families adapt to having more time to socialize children.<p>All of the above turn out to be reasons to homeschool; it&#x27;s a very nice game theory picture - cooperate or defect! - what is best for my local society is that I send my children to the public school, vigorously fight for excellent academics and rigorous training of character, and make a tiny difference. What is best for my children is that I send them to a highly ranked private school or homeschool them, sacrificing either my or my spouse&#x27;s career to give them 1:1 personal tutoring and drive them to the top of their potential.<p>edit:<p>As a clarifying note, there are about 4ish groups of homeschoolers in the US, broadly stroked out:<p>- Academic - v. common. US public schools are often bad.<p>- Religious (Young Earth Creationists etc)<p>- Difficult&#x2F;gifted child has inability to cope with school<p>- Unschooling &amp; crew &quot;hippie&quot; stuff<p>I have absolutely <i>zero</i> sympathy for the unschooling world, both philosophically and from an outcomes perspective. It&#x27;s a deep disservice to the child&#x27;s potential. Again, Old Tom Sawyer loved playing hooky: don&#x27;t enable it...<p>Religious homeschooling is highly variable. A lot of it is video curricula. It can range from straight up traditional latin&#x2F;greek heavy-duty academic rigor all the way over into some drivel that is a bare pastiche of what might be an education. I would advise not writing it off, but looking a bit closer at the curricula. Most is quite adequate at the basic stuff as I recall.<p>And, of course, all sympathy to the people struggling with the difficult children.",

I don&#x27;t know if there are any particular people you had in mind whose recommendations you&#x27;d like to see, but there are a few HN bigwigs who&#x27;d probably be willing to generally endorse it :-) Also, it&#x27;s been posted on HN a few times before, so it&#x27;s had some scrutiny. That doesn&#x27;t mean I don&#x27;t make mistakes, but generally speaking, an active reader should be OK.<p>The other thing is in the way the book is structured. I teach you to break crypto; so when I say something is broken, I prove it by showing you how to break it.<p>Finally, the goal of this book is absolutely not to help you implement DHE. In an ideal world, the primitives we offer people are hard to misuse. Crypto 101 then only exists to satisfy programmer curiosity. It is not a replacement for a traditional academic education that will help you design new primitives; it also doesn&#x27;t show you how to write secure implementations. However, Crypto 101 is still useful beyond merely satisfying curiosity now, because most cryptographic libraries _do not_ provide that easy-to-use API. Using regular hashes for password storage, various forms of broken AES-CBC (unauthenticated, key=IV, static IV...), et cetera are very real problems for real code, and Crypto 101 teaches you how to avoid that minefield.<p>I&#x27;m also working on the &quot;better, more accessible&quot; crypto part, but I only have so much free time :)",

In terms of direction setting, a final authority amd so forth, it is their call.  They talk to their management and other teams and tell us what to work on, but are not involved in the technical day to day and are not micromanaging the details.  So I might do the Android client, X does the web API which uses JSON, Y is the DBA designing the database schema, Z does iOS and so forth.  It is not ruderless as they can make the final decision.<p>With a team lead, you have one person on the team doing work who is also doling out work.  It can lead to all of the problems mentioned in the arricle.<p>Also - small, underfunded companies usually can not get a good experienced programmer or administrator.  So the hires are the inexperienced types who could probably use a team lead.  But the companies are too small to have one.  By the time someone has a resume to be good enough to join a company which can afford a larger tech team with a manager, an experienced lead and several somewhat experienced programmers - the need for a lead is much less.  Besides, people are naturally going to defer somewhat to a more experienced engineer who has been at the company longer.<p>I think the bottleneck and bus factor points are key.  The tendency would be for the lead to own the most high-visible, business impacting piece of the code base, and dole out less attractive and impactful pieces to others.  It can waste time as well - they can assign work but are too busy to really go over it, then after a week you show them what you did, but they did not mention they like things done with MVC, or TDD, or whatever, so then you have to spend another week doing it over.  As the article says, they&#x27;re overloaded and often enough away from the team.  Instead of having four or five autonomonous engineers going at full blast, you have one overloaded engineer who hogs more of the critical, business visible code than they can handle, and the other engineer whose time it is to waste.  Who are usually not much less experienced than the lead.<p>The flip side to &quot;design by committee&quot; is that one person is designing every thing!  That person is too overloaded to design everything as needed, so you have the non-leads writing code for a week, that will be thrown away until the lead has time to come back around and decide how your project will be designed.<p>An ex-engineer manager does not have their hand in day to day, and many of these conflicts go away, whereas the needed leadership is there if necessary.  I&#x27;m surprised people feel otherwise.  The alternative to design by committee is often everyone waiting on the one overloaded person who has to design the whole system.",

It&#x27;s developed for building complex and large web applications, in a safe an eficient way.<p>I&#x27;m talking from my experience: We have developed a k3-k6 elearning&#x2F;game platform in two months. Actually, it has 5 game types, a game creator&#x2F;editor, user profiles, game boards.. it has around 20 to 30 routes (mostly dinamic) serving stored games and boards. Around 50 to 60 components (with some of them using pixi.js as a canvas render engine)<p>And despite of the growing feature list, we are still super confortable with the codebase. (We are just on the second iteration, starting the three).. You know something is good, when you are able to throw away parts of it and rewrite them without much drama....<p>The main application build, when gziped is around 380K ( Think that only firebase + pixi.js are around 150). But also we know that we will be able to split features (modules) for lazy loading them.. (and also our build will be smaller... because soon will be able to treeshake it)<p>PD: If your main use case is build a slider for a wordpress theme, angular doesn&#x27;t fit, but instead, if you think on building (a desktop grade) application for the browser, even for the mobile browser you will find angular your best alliated.",

When charging a capacitor one must not think in terms of voltage (which is an effect, not a cause of charging) but of current.<p>&gt; The important factor for charging time is how many joules&#x2F;second you can stuff in, not how much current (coulombs&#x2F;second) is flowing.<p>You&#x27;re confusing cause and effect. Capacitor charging is accomplished with current -- voltage is an effect, not a cause.<p>The voltage on a capacitor is the time integral of past applied currents. Want to change the charge level on a capacitor? Apply a current and let the voltage change <i>in response</i>.<p>&gt; You can pull a helluva lot more joules&#x2F;second out of a wall outlet than you can a micro-USB connector.<p>Non sequitur, the issue is how much current the capacitor can tolerate. And attaching a capacitor to a wall outlet <i>will not work</i> for multiple reasons.<p>The ideal charging source for a capacitor is a constant-current supply set to provide a high, but not damaging, level of current, then when the capacitor&#x27;s voltage limit is approached, shut down the current supply.<p>The worst possible source for a capacitor is a constant voltage with substantial power available, which will destroy the device.<p>As I originally said, &quot;Capacitors aren&#x27;t charged by voltage, they&#x27;re charged by current.&quot; Concise, and quite accurate.",

High-value industrial diamonds are usually higher quality than jewelry-grade diamonds (IF-VVS clarity, D-F color, low stress, etc.) and are used in applications like high pressure anvils and optics for lasers.  A large portion of our current production ends up in the last category, as well as in jewelry.<p>We are currently focused on high-quality single-crystal diamonds.

		"text": "Assuming you want to provide IPv4 and IPv6 to the outside:<p>You can relatively easily map IPv4 addresses into IPv6 range: just pick a &#x2F;96 prefix and append the 32 bit IPv6 address. This is a relatively easy translation, that does not require the machine doing the translation to keep state <i>!!!</i> (so you can send traffic to a random one and it can do the right thing, no need to have connections stick to one). It is thus quite easy to make an IPv6-only network deal with IPv4 clients. With decreasing IPv4 usage, your network naturally adapts since it only becomes easier.<p>The reverse is not easily possible for serving IPv6 clients from an IPv4 network: you can&#x27;t map IPv6 1:1 to IPv4, so your gateways have to be more like traditional NAT and keep state tables around, which makes operation in general and load-balancing&#x2F;fail-over in particular harder.  The more and more IPv6 clients you have, the more resources you need for the translation. And at some point in the future, you are going to want to switch.<p>You could alternatively run your entire DC on IPv4 and IPv6 double-stack, but that adds a lot of unnecessary complexity. Your routers now have to keep routing tables for both around, behavior could differ for both, your applications (logging, fraud prevention, ...) have to understand both, ...<p>If you are in a position where you control everything you run (so you can make sure there aren&#x27;t any stragglers that require IPv4 because their vendor doesn&#x27;t care or something like that), the IPv6 model can be attractive. Do the switch and be done with it for the future, limit your dealings with two protocols to the very edge.",

So for example if I spent an hour watching a television show and later felt I had wasted an hour watching TV, I could go back and re-score that to &quot;I wanted to watch television and I did, why are my priorities for that time different now than they were then?&quot;<p>And for me, there were two things that were key to me getting better with my time. One was to be explicit about my priorities, and the other is the bin packing problem.<p>If you spend three hours on things, separated by 15 minutes between hours, you end up &quot;losing&quot; 45 minutes because 15 minutes is too short to spin up a new task but long enough to be meaningful.<p>If I wanted to address the bin-packing problem then it meant being a lot more thoughtful about planning my use of time. And doing three one hour things back to back (with a plan to switch tasks at the earlier of &quot;I&#x27;m done&quot; or &quot;it&#x27;s been an hour&quot; that coalesces the three 15 minute chunks into one 45 minute chunk which is enough time to watch an hour long TV show if you can skip all the commercials.",

This means that the LOAD takes place in the same package, but if the file being loaded changes to a different package, that effect is lost when the LOAD completes.<p>In other words, the designers thought about this issue (how loading interacts with the package system) and made a clear decision: same package is used over the load, but the loaded file is prevented from altering the caller&#x27;s current package: they decided that the parent being able to establish a package and read table for the loaded child is useful flexibility, but the reverse situation being error-prone.<p>That decision is a reasonable one. I thought about the same issue in TXR Lisp and copied the decision made by ANSI CL, recognizing its wisdom.<p>Note that when LOAD loads a <i>compiled</i> file, then the symbols in that file are not affected by the current package. They are not being read from source code any more. (That is no longer textual inclusion).<p>Lisp supports textual inclusion in the sense that you can load a file that is raw source code, without being forced to compile it first. That is useful and good; why not support such a thing? Being able to set up a package or read table and then do a bunch of loads which then take place in the context of that package is also useful and good.<p>Lisp doesn&#x27;t force you into textual inclusion. Even for macros, you don&#x27;t have to use textual inclusion. A module containing macros can be compiled with COMPILE-FILE. Then that file can be loaded as a compiled file, by the compiler, when other files are being compiled (files which need those macros).<p>Please, don&#x27;t compare Lisp with C #include!",

Most transit in Manhattan is by foot, and you will have separated pedestrians from commercial entryways. As it stands, a great deal of storefronts—even in the most commercial and highly trafficked parts of the city—are in mixed-use buildings, with apartments in the upper stories. Now most potential customers, instead of walking past shop after shop, are walking past residences. Signs may point out what lies below. Presumably this would cut into businesses which rely on customers popping in without planning to; if you weren&#x27;t going to exit onto that block for something else anyway, why make the climb down to commercial level just for a little something that caught your eye?<p>And how <i>did</i> it catch your eye? Stores could no longer entice with a storefront, by showing off their inventory and sales. Restaurants, bakeries, and coffee shops could no longer waft out onto potential guests. They&#x27;d be in virtual basements, and would be much less attractive for that reason alone. Manhattan has a history of severing its residents from one thing or another—waterfronts are the first to come to mind—but I would be surprised to see them do this.<p>Of course, not everything has to remain as is and the city may evolve (as it has before), but this sort of plan would require much more work than building a tiered roadway.<p>Maybe in the future, when &#x27;brick and mortar&#x27; starts to fail even in densely populated areas, the problems described above won&#x27;t be problems anymore. But then, neither would the traffic; and the tiered roadway would be redundant, and not worth the money to maintain (nor the daylight lost).",

Well now what happened is, one of our base commanders, he had a sort of, well he went a little funny in the head. You know. Just a little... funny. And uh, he went and did a silly thing. Well, I&#x27;ll tell you what he did, he ordered his planes... to attack your country.&quot;<p>&quot;Listen, I&#x27;ve been all over this with your ambassador. It is not a trick. Well I&#x27;ll tell you. We&#x27;d like to give your air staff a complete run down on the targets, the flight plans, and the defensive systems of the planes. Yes! I mean, if we&#x27;re unable to recall the planes, then I&#x27;d say that, uh, well, we&#x27;re just going to have to help you destroy them, Dimitri. I know they&#x27;re our boys.&quot;<p>&quot;Who should we call? Who should we call, Dimitri? The people...? Sorry, you faded away there. The People&#x27;s Central Air Defense Headquarters. Where is that, Dimitri? In Omsk. Right. Yes. Oh, you&#x27;ll call them first, will you? Uh huh. Listen, do you happen to have the phone number on you, Dimitri? What?&quot;&quot;<p>... (later) ...<p>&quot;DeSadeski: the deciding factor was when we learned that your country was working along similar lines, and we were afraid of a doomsday gap.<p>President: This is preposterous. I&#x27;ve never approved of anything like that.<p>DeSadeski: Our source was the New York Times.<p>President: Dr. Strangelove, do we have anything like that in the works?<p>Dr Strangelove: Under the authority granted me as director of weapons research and development, I commissioned last year a study of this project by the Bland corporation. Based on the findings of the report, my conclusion was that this idea was not a practical deterrent, for reasons which, at this moment, must be all too obvious.<p>Dr Strangelove: it&#x27;s remarkably simple to do that. When you merely wish to bury bombs, there is no limit to the size. After that they are connected to a gigantic complex of computers. Now then, a specific and clearly defined set of circumstances, under which the bombs are to be exploded, is programmed into a tape memory bank.<p>but the... whole point of the doomsday machine... is lost... if you keep it a secret!

My experiences were usually alone, or in small groups with an occasional concert.<p>I was lucky to always use Magic Mushrooms that we just picked fresh. I had a friend that was a botanist that helped us with identification.<p>My most spiritual experiences, and by far most favorite were with mushrooms and once with mescaline. Connections to the natural world and to the people I was with became strong and positive and enduring.<p>I think all of my experiences have helped me see connections (I can connect the dots on many levels) and to believe in the power of the mind.  I am passionate about life, family, work but I am calm and know that the little things are the little things.  But I was so young it could be I am who I am and these experiences had no bearing on who I am now. I don&#x27;t believe that but I am open to that possibility.<p>I had one bad trip on acid. It was snowing so when I closed my eyes everything was white. I was bored for 6 hours. So not a horrible experience just a waste of time.<p>I will say that I was lucky to experience Pink Floyd, the Grateful Dead, Uriah Heap, Ted Nugent, Jethro Tull, Bob Seger and others live on hallucinogens. And doing acid and listening to firesign theater albums was pretty cool. To this day Pink Floyd is a go to comfort band for me.<p>Two videos that you might like to see:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;s182g4vwprA\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;s182g4vwprA</a> A few scientists talking about mushrooms\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;TWnkYkKGzs8\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;TWnkYkKGzs8</a> A 61 year old mom taking muschrooms for the first time",

In my opinion the majority of kids I knew were just fine socially. There was also a small percentage that had significant trouble making friends and vocalizing their thoughts, however that was the exception rather than the rule.<p>Being homeschooled I had a completely different childhood than most of my peers, and that alone can make it more difficult to connect with people.  At the same time I can also tell if someone my age was homeschooled just by listening to them talk, so finding other people with similar backgrounds usually isn&#x27;t too hard.",

It was awful.<p>For what it&#x27;s worth, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s C&#x27;s pthread library that is painful, but POSIX threading in general. Languages and libraries try to &quot;simplify&quot; threading by re-inventing pthreads.  Eg: python&#x27;s &#x27;threading&#x27; module, erlang in general, java &#x27;runnable&#x27; interface, golang&#x27;s &#x27;coroutine&#x27; thread manager...etc.<p>The difference between all those languages specific threading implementation and POSIX threads, are that POSIX threads work across <i>every</i> language, and all those implementations are only relevant to the language itself. Working with &quot;one size fits all&quot;(pthread) tools is inherently more complex than a simplified tool specific to one language.<p>Summary: once you learn POSIX threading [well] in C, using other pthread abstractions in other languages becomes much easier.",

The rest of the tracking sensors&#x2F;LEDs and whatnot can be built into the headset.<p>Meanwhile you&#x27;re expected to pay $700 for a phone and $700 for a headset, each of which has about an 70% overlap in the most expensive components.<p>On top of all that, it sucks that the headsets for full featured VR vary in comfort and design but are hard wired to the displays.  Most reviews say Vive is the least comfortable of the batch but the most immersive.<p>Ideally the head mount would be a separate thing from the display&#x2F;processor like in the mobile VR space.  That would allow you to find the head mount most comfortable for you, and also to upgrade your VR internals while keeping the same head mount for several generations of technology.<p>So in my ideal world, VR would be a licensed or open standard system like Dolby whatever or THX are for audio.  For example, if you bought a phone with the Whizbang VR logo on it, it would work with your Whizbang VR logo head tracking sensors, Whizbang VR logo head mount, Whizbang VR logo controllers, and be compatible with the Whizbang VR software API.  But all that stuff could be made by different manufacturers.",
